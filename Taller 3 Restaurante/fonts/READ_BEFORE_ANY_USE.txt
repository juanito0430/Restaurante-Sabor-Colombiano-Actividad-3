-----------------------

Amarego is a decorative display typeface with a confident, flowing presence and a soft sense of drama.

The letterforms are bold and rounded, with sweeping curves and expressive terminals that give the font a lively rhythm. Its style draws from vintage signage and ornamental lettering, but keeps a clean balance that makes it feel contemporary. Each character connects visually with the next, creating words that feel sculpted rather than simply written.

The font is built with advanced OpenType functionality and guaranteed top-notch quality, containing stylistic and contextual alternates, ligatures and more automatic and manual features; all to give you full control and customizability. 
It has extensive lingual support, covering all Latin-based languages, from North Europa to South Africa, from America to South-East Asia. It contains all characters and symbols you'll ever need, including all punctuation and numbers. 

Amarego was designed as a display face with personality at its core. The goal was to create letterforms that feel generous and expressive, while still remaining readable and well-structured. It is a font that invites attention without forcing it, letting the shapes speak through subtle movement and weight.
